# ArUco Raspi 3

* Implement ArUco markers in OpenCV on the Raspberry pi 3.
* Configurable Dictionary size
* If possible, accelerate OpenCV with the Raspberry Pi GPU.
  * If an OpenCL library exists, use it. Otherwise consider the possibility of implementing it manually or extending OpenCL to the Raspberry Pi 3 (VideoCore IV) platform.
* Integrate the library with KIPR [libwallaby](https://github.com/kipr/libwallaby).
